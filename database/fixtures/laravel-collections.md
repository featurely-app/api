## Brief history 
Laravel has a support library dubbed illuminate. Illuminate has several Php components, one of the most popular among them being Collections. Although no big deal to install, adding [Collect.js](https://collect.js.org/) in as a core provider or as a sub-service of a AdonisSupport provider (similar to illuminate) would provide Laravel Collections within adonis.js for those who are not already aware of collect.js


## More Information about collect.js
Very clear documentation that matches Laravel's collection API all but perfectly. The small differences between collect.js and illuminate/collections are very clearly documented. This package is also highly tested and has zero other non-dev dependencies. 

## What problem does it solve?
This doesn't solve a specific problem, but rather helps push adonisjs and encourages those already familiar and in love with Laravel and Laravel Collections to also fall in love with adonis and collect.js. Enhancement more than anything.

## Proposal
[collect.js docs](https://collect.js.org/)
[laravel collection docs](https://laravel.com/docs/7.x/collections)
[collect.js repo](https://github.com/ecrmnn/collect.js)
[laravel collections repo (Illuminate)](https://github.com/illuminate/collections)
[collect.js non-implemented methods vs. laravel](https://collect.js.org/api.html#methods-that-have-not-been-implemented)


## Are you willing to work on it?
Maybe, either way this issue wouldn't take very long to implement.
